### Introduction
The [FREE AWS Cloud Project Bootcamp 2023](https://aws.cloudprojectbootcamp.com/) is a comprehensive training program that aims to equip individuals with the necessary skills and knowledge to successfully design, build, and implement a cloud project. Through hands-on experience, participants will learn how to apply their cloud expertise in a practical setting and showcase their abilities to potential employers or organizations.

This repository contains my notes, details, insights, and a version of the [original codebase](https://github.com/omenking/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023) that has been re-configured and updated to meet the goals and objectives of the boot camp outlined in the ["Journaling"](README.md#journaling) section below.
