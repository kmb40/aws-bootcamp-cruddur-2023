The following information outlines tasks that I've completed for Week 0 of the bootcamp.  
#### Watched a series of videos and attended the live stream.

#### Creating an admin account
My objectives here were to create an admin account and enabled multi-factor authentication (MFA). I have an existing account prior to this project so I decided to use AWS organizations https://aws.amazon.com/organizations/ to make account management easier. As such, I created an new orgination and within the organizations, I added a new AWS account for this project.  

#### Homework Challenges
Additionally, I destroyed the root account credentials, reset them and re-enabled multi-factor authentication (MFA) since I had it active already. 

#### Use CloudShell
After launching this service from the console menu, I activated Auto-prompt. [Auto-prompt](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-parameters-prompting.html) which functions similar to [Googles auto suggest](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/7368877?hl=en#:~:text=Autocomplete%20is%20a%20feature%20within,they%20already%20intended%20to%20do.) feature. I then called the `aws sts get-caller-identity` command as seen below.

#### Generated AWS Credentials  
I generated Access Keys and intend to use them for AWS CLI access.  

#### Install AWS CLI  
I installed AWS CLI in a gitpod workspace.

#### Create a Billing Alarm
I configured a billing alarm by selecting the two alarms options in the "billing preferences" section of the "account" page. As illustarted in [Chirag's Week 0 - Spend Considerations](#2-watched-chirags-week-0---spend-considerations). I completed setup a new billing alarm in Cloud Watch and created an SNS Topics to faciliated email notifications.

#### Create an AWS Budget
I configured two "cost" budgets. One using the template for "Zero Spend" and the other custom for AWS credits.  
<img width="450" alt="Screenshot 2023-02-14 at 6 36 04 PM" src="/assets/budgets.png">  
**Note:** During AWS budget creation from an IAM admin account, I was presented with a "You need permissions" error. ![budget-error](/assets/budget-error.png).  
I ultimately resovled this by activating IAM Access in the "IAM User and Role Access to Billing Information" section of the root accounts "account" section. In other words; Root user --> Account --> "IAM User and Role Access to Billing Information". [Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_billing.html?icmpid=docs_iam_console#tutorial-billing-step1).  
**Note:** The free tier only allows for two budgets. 

#### Homework Challenges
- Destroy your root account credentials, Set MFA, IAM role
- Use EventBridge to hookup Health Dashboard to SNS and send notification when there is a service health issue.
- Review all the questions of each pillars in the Well Architected Tool (No specialized lens)
- Create an architectural diagram (to the best of your ability) the CI/CD logical pipeline in Lucid Charts
- Research the technical and service limits of specific services and how they could impact the technical path for technical flexibility. 
- Open a support ticket and request a service limit
