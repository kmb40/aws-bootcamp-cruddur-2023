#### Implement Custom Signin Page
Implemented a custom signin page levraging AWS Cognito. Integrated code at Frontend-react-js/ App.js, HomeFeedPage.js, Signin.js, docker-compose.yml and others as relfect at https://github.com/omenking/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/week-3/journal/week3.md . Setup a new user in AWS Cognito. Testing and confirmed login. Updated name and username attributes. Per instruction, the user was removed from Cognito since CLI workaround is required to address the forced to change password status assigned to users created in Cognito.

**Note:** Revisited ["Week 2 - X-Ray Subsegments Solved"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SGTW0Db5y0&list=PLBfufR7vyJJ7k25byhRXJldB5AiwgNnWv&index=38) as it was added after I had submitted homework for week 2. Made and tested the suggested changes succesfully. Hat tip to @Olley article which is referenced in the video @ https://olley.hashnode.dev/aws-free-cloud-bootcamp-instrumenting-aws-x-ray-subsegments
