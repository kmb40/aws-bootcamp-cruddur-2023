Per instruction, the user was removed from Cognito since CLI workaround is required to address the forced to change password status assigned to users created in Cognito.

#### Implement Custom Signup Page
Implemented a custom signup page leveraging AWS Cognito. Integrated code at Frontend-react-js/ [ConfigurationPage.js](https://github.com/kmb40/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/week-3/frontend-react-js/src/pages/ConfirmationPage.js), [SignupPage.js](https://github.com/kmb40/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/week-3/frontend-react-js/src/pages/SignupPage.js), [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/kmb40/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/week-3/docker-compose.yml) and others as relfect at https://github.com/omenking/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/week-3/journal/week3.md.
