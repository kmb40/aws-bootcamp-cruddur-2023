Per instruction, the user I created was removed from Cognito since CLI workaround is required to address the forced to change password status assigned to users created in Cognito.

#### Implement Custom Signup Page
Implemented a custom signup page leveraging AWS Cognito. Integrated code at Frontend-react-js/ [ConfigurationPage.js](https://github.com/kmb40/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/week-3/frontend-react-js/src/pages/ConfirmationPage.js), [SignupPage.js](https://github.com/kmb40/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/week-3/frontend-react-js/src/pages/SignupPage.js), [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/kmb40/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/week-3/docker-compose.yml) and others as relfected at https://github.com/omenking/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/week-3/journal/week3.md.

**Note:** Revisited ["Week 2 - X-Ray Subsegments Solved"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SGTW0Db5y0&list=PLBfufR7vyJJ7k25byhRXJldB5AiwgNnWv&index=38) as it was added after I had submitted homework for week 2. Updated [Week 2 Journal to reflect](https://github.com/kmb40/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/week-2/journal/week2.md#instrumented-aws-x-ray-subsegments). Made and tested the suggested changes succesfully.
