# Week 8 â€” Serverless Image Processing

The following information outlines tasks that I've completed for Week 8 of the bootcamp.  

The **objective** was to allow end users of the application to upload their own profile avatar. To accomplish this, I developed and deployed a serverless functionality with object storage and event-bus actions.

### Prep Environment 

### Installed the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)
Essentially the CDK is used for creating, managing, and deleting infrastructure (services, VMs, DBs, etc) using a progaming language. CDK accomplishes this by producing CloudFormation templates, which are what is used to build your AWS infrastructure. [Reference - AWS Docs on CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/home.html)

#### Bootstraped environment
The purpose of bootstrapping is to create a deployment environment in an AWS account that can be used to store and manage the resources required to deploy and manage CDK applications.  
- Run `cdk bootstrap "aws://$AWS_ACCOUNT_ID/$AWS_DEFAULT_REGION"`

#### Created directory for Cloud Development Kit(CDK) Pipeline
- Created a new directory named `thumbing-serverless-cdk`  
```
cd /workspace/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023
mkdir thumbing-serverless-cdk
```  
- [Ref - thumbing-serverless-cdk](https://github.com/kmb40/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/tree/main/thumbing-serverless-cdk)
- Installed the AWS CDK using `npm install aws-cdk -g`.  

#### Configured s3

##### Configured s3 Permissions

##### Configured API Gateway
- **Note:** Activating access logging for the "default" stage caused noticable daily spend.  

#### Configured lamda
